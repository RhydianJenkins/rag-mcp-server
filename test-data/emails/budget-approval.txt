Sarah,

Good news! The finance committee has approved the budget request for the new cloud infrastructure. We have $150,000 allocated for Q1-Q2.

Here's the breakdown:
- AWS services: $80,000
- Monitoring tools: $25,000
- Database licenses: $30,000
- Contingency: $15,000

Please work with procurement to get the necessary vendor contracts in place. We'll need to have everything set up by March 1st to stay on schedule.

Let me know if you need any clarification on the budget allocations.

Best,
James
