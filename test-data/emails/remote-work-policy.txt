Hello Team,

After gathering feedback from the company survey and discussing with leadership, we're updating our remote work policy effective February 1st.

New Policy:
- 3 days in office, 2 days remote (previously was 4 days in office)
- Required in-office days: Tuesdays and Thursdays (for team collaboration)
- You choose your other in-office day (Monday, Wednesday, or Friday)
- Fully remote employees (living >100 miles away) are unaffected

Why the change?
We heard loud and clear that the commute was impacting work-life balance. We also noticed that Monday and Friday were ghost towns anyway. This gives everyone a predictable schedule while maintaining face time for collaboration.

Important notes:
- You can still come in 5 days if you want (some people prefer office)
- Manager approval required for exceptions
- This is a 6-month trial - we'll reassess in July
- VPN and home office equipment stipends remain the same

We know this doesn't make everyone happy (some wanted fully remote, some wanted full in-office), but we think this is a good middle ground. Let's try it out and see how it goes.

Questions? Join the Q&A session Friday at 3 PM or email hr@company.com.

Thanks,
HR Team
