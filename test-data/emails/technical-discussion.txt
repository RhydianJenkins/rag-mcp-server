Subject: Database Migration Strategy Discussion

Hey everyone,

I've been researching our database migration from PostgreSQL to a distributed setup, and I wanted to share my findings and get your feedback.

Current Issues:
- Query performance degrading with dataset size
- Single point of failure concerns
- Scaling limitations for read-heavy workloads

Proposed Solutions:
1. Implement read replicas for better load distribution
2. Consider sharding for horizontal scalability
3. Evaluate CockroachDB or YugabyteDB for distributed SQL

I think option 1 is the quickest win and buys us time to properly evaluate option 3. Option 2 would require significant application changes.

I've prepared a detailed technical document comparing the approaches. Let's discuss this in our architecture review meeting next Tuesday.

Thoughts? Any other approaches we should consider?
