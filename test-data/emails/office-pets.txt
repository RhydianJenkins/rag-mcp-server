Hey everyone!

Great news - after months of discussions with building management, we finally got approval to allow dogs in the office on Fridays! There are some rules we need to follow though:

Building Policy for Dogs:
- Dogs allowed ONLY on Fridays (no other days unfortunately)
- Must be registered with facilities at least 48 hours in advance
- Maximum 5 dogs per floor due to space constraints
- Dogs must be well-behaved, leashed at all times in common areas
- No dogs allowed in the kitchen, conference rooms, or server room
- Owners are responsible for cleanup (waste bags available at reception)
- All dogs must be up to date on vaccinations (proof required)

Please be respectful of colleagues with allergies - we've designated the 3rd floor as a pet-free zone for anyone who needs it.

If you plan to bring your dog this Friday, email facilities@company.com with your dog's name, breed, and a photo. First come first served!

I'm so excited to meet everyone's furry friends!

Jen
HR Manager

P.S. - Cats are still not allowed per building management. Sorry cat people :(
