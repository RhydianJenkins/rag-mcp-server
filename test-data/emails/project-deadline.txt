Hi Team,

I wanted to send a quick reminder about our Q1 project deadline coming up on February 28th. We're currently tracking well, but there are a few areas that need attention.

Outstanding Items:
- API documentation needs to be completed by Feb 10th
- Performance testing should wrap up by Feb 15th
- User acceptance testing scheduled for Feb 20-25th

Please review your assigned tasks in JIRA and update the status. If you're blocked on anything or foresee any delays, let me know ASAP so we can adjust resources.

Also, reminder that we have our sprint review this Friday at 2 PM. Please come prepared to discuss your progress.

Thanks,
Sarah
