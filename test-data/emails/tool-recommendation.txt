Hey team,

I've been researching alternatives to Jira because, let's be honest, everyone hates it. I spent the last two weeks testing Linear and I think we should seriously consider switching.

Why Linear is better:
- It's FAST. Like, shockingly fast. No more waiting 5 seconds for a page to load.
- Keyboard shortcuts for everything. You can create, assign, and close tickets without touching your mouse.
- Clean, minimal UI that doesn't make my eyes bleed.
- Great GitHub integration. PRs automatically link to tickets.
- Actually good mobile app (Jira's is a dumpster fire).
- Their API doesn't make me want to cry.

The downsides:
- It costs $8/user/month (Jira is $7, so slightly more expensive).
- Less customizable than Jira (but maybe that's a feature not a bug?).
- No built-in time tracking (we'd need a separate tool).
- Smaller ecosystem of integrations.

Migration would be annoying but doable. Linear has Jira import tools and I tested it with a sample project - worked pretty well.

I did a quick poll and 14 out of 18 engineers said they'd prefer Linear over Jira. The other 4 were indifferent.

My recommendation: Let's do a one-month trial with the backend team. If they like it, we roll it out to everyone. If not, we stick with Jira.

Thoughts?

Kevin
