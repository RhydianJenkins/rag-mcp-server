Subject: URGENT: Security Incident - Action Required
From: Security Team <security@company.com>

Team,

We detected suspicious activity on our production systems at 3:47 AM this morning. While we don't believe any customer data was compromised, we're taking this very seriously and need everyone's cooperation.

What happened:
- Unusual API calls from an unrecognized IP address in Eastern Europe
- Attempted access to our admin endpoints
- Multiple failed authentication attempts followed by one successful login
- The account used was a former contractor's that should have been deactivated

What we've done:
- Immediately locked down the affected account
- Rotated all API keys and tokens
- Enabled additional MFA requirements on admin accounts
- Brought in our external security firm to conduct a full audit

What you need to do:
1. Change your password immediately (use the password reset link in the separate email)
2. Review your recent commits for any accidentally committed secrets
3. Check your local machines for any suspicious activity
4. Report anything unusual to security@company.com

We'll have a mandatory all-hands security training next week. Calendar invites will go out later today.

I know this is disruptive, but security is our top priority. Please treat this with urgency.

Marcus Webb
Head of Security
