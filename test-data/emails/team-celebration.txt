TEAM!!!

WE'RE #1 ON PRODUCT HUNT TODAY!!!

I know I said no emojis in work emails but I don't even care right now. We hit #1 Product of the Day and we're trending towards Product of the Week!

The numbers are INSANE:
- 2,847 upvotes (and climbing)
- 312 comments (mostly positive!)
- 1,200+ new signups TODAY
- Trending #1 on Twitter in tech category
- Featured in TechCrunch, The Verge, and Hacker News

This is everything we worked towards for the past year. The late nights, the pivot, the bugs, the stress - it was all worth it.

Special shoutouts:
- Engineering team for building something people actually want
- Design team for making it beautiful
- Product team for the vision
- Support team who are absolutely drowning in tickets right now (sorry!)

CEO is buying drinks at Murphy's Bar tonight at 6 PM. Everyone's invited. If you're remote, expense a nice dinner on us.

This is just the beginning. Let's keep this momentum going!

SO PROUD OF THIS TEAM!!

Marketing Director
