Sarah,

I wanted to reach out privately because I'm getting concerned about the team's morale and I'm not sure if you're seeing the same signals I am.

Over the past few weeks I've noticed people seem more stressed than usual. Mike has been working until 9pm most nights, Emily mentioned she's burnt out in our 1-on-1, and I overheard a few people talking about updating their resumes in the break room yesterday. That last one really worried me.

I think it's a combination of things. The CloudSync Pro deadline is super aggressive and people feel like we're being set up to fail. We lost two senior engineers last quarter and never backfilled them so everyone's picking up extra work. And I know there were some complaints about the holiday bonus being smaller than expected.

I don't want to be alarmist but I genuinely think we might lose some good people if we don't address this. Maybe we could push back on the March 15th launch date? Or at least have a conversation with the team about expectations and get their input? I feel like right now they're just being told what to do without any say in how or when.

Also, and this might be controversial, but I think we should consider hiring at least one more senior engineer immediately rather than waiting for the Q2 budget cycle. Yes it'll be expensive but losing institutional knowledge and having to train replacements later would be way more costly.

Anyway, I wanted to share my observations. Would love to get your take on this - maybe I'm reading too much into it, or maybe you've already got a plan in motion.

Let me know if you want to grab coffee and talk through it.

Jennifer
