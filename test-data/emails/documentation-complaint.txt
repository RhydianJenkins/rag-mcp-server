Subject: Can we please fix the documentation?

I'm sorry to be that person but I need to vent about our documentation situation because it's actively hurting productivity.

I just spent 3 hours trying to figure out how to use the PaymentService class. Here's what I found:

1. The README says "See docs/payments.md" - that file doesn't exist.
2. The code comments say "TODO: document this" - from 2 years ago.
3. The wiki page is from 2023 and references methods that no longer exist.
4. Asked in Slack, got 3 different answers, all wrong.
5. Finally just read the source code and figured it out myself.

This is not sustainable. Every new hire goes through this same painful process. Every feature takes longer because we're reverse-engineering our own codebase.

I get it - documentation is boring. Nobody wants to write it. But here's the thing: the 3 hours I wasted today could have been spent building features. Multiply that by every engineer, every week, and we're talking about serious lost productivity.

Proposal:
- Make documentation a requirement for PR approval (just like tests)
- Spend one sprint doing a "documentation cleanup" where we just fix everything
- Set up automated checks to warn when public APIs are undocumented
- Maybe hire a technical writer?

I know we're all busy but we need to solve this. Who's with me?

P.S. - I'm going to start a shared doc where we can list all the undocumented stuff. Will share the link tomorrow.
