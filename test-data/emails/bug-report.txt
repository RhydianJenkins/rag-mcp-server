URGENT - Critical Bug

We've identified a critical bug in the payment processing system that's affecting approximately 5% of transactions.

Symptoms:
- Payment confirmation emails not being sent
- Transactions showing as "pending" indefinitely
- Users being charged but orders not being fulfilled

Impact:
- ~50 affected customers in the last 24 hours
- Customer support receiving numerous complaints
- Potential revenue loss and reputation damage

Root Cause Analysis:
After investigating, it appears the issue is related to the recent deployment on January 17th. The new retry logic in the payment webhook handler is causing race conditions.

Immediate Actions Taken:
- Rolled back the deployment to previous stable version
- Manually processed affected orders
- Sent apology emails to impacted customers

We need to:
1. Fix the race condition in the webhook handler
2. Add better error handling and logging
3. Implement monitoring alerts for stuck transactions
4. Review our deployment process to prevent this

I've created ticket ENG-1547 to track this work. Let's prioritize this for the current sprint.
