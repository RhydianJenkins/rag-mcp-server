Hi Alex,

I wanted to follow up on our performance review conversation from yesterday with some written notes for your records.

Overall: Excellent performance this quarter. You've really stepped up and shown great leadership on the mobile app rewrite.

Strengths:
- Technical skills continue to be top-notch. Your React Native architecture is solid.
- Great mentor to junior developers. Sarah and Mike both mentioned how helpful you've been.
- Excellent communication in standups and sprint planning.
- Took initiative on the accessibility improvements without being asked.

Areas for growth:
- Sometimes you take on too much and then get overwhelmed. It's okay to push back or ask for help.
- Code review turnaround time could be faster. Try to review PRs within 24 hours when possible.
- Would love to see you present more in engineering all-hands meetings.

For next quarter, let's focus on:
- Leading the iOS migration project
- Mentoring one junior dev more formally
- Speaking at our engineering conference in March (if you're interested?)

Rating: Exceeds Expectations
Salary adjustment: 8% increase effective Feb 1
Bonus: $5,000

Let me know if you want to discuss anything. Really proud of your work!

Rachel
