Subject: ESCALATED: Major Client Threatening to Churn

Engineering Leadership,

We have a serious situation with Acme Corp (our 3rd largest customer, $500K ARR). They're threatening to cancel their contract next month unless we fix critical performance issues.

The Problem:
Their dashboard is taking 30-45 seconds to load. It used to be under 5 seconds. This started happening after our Dec 15th deployment. They have ~50,000 users and the slowness is making their product unusable.

What they're experiencing:
- Dashboard queries timing out during peak hours (9am-5pm EST)
- Report generation failing completely for datasets over 10K rows
- Mobile app crashing when trying to sync data
- Their customers are complaining to them, and they're complaining to us

What we've tried:
- Database indexes (helped a bit but not enough)
- Increased server capacity (no improvement)
- Rolled back to previous version (broke other features they need)

What we need:
- Senior backend engineer to investigate ASAP
- Database expert to review query performance
- DevOps to check infrastructure bottlenecks
- Someone to be on a call with them tomorrow at 2 PM

Their VP of Engineering said "If this isn't fixed by end of month, we're moving to CompetitorX." That's 12 days from now.

This is all hands on deck territory. Can we get a war room set up today?

Customer Success Manager
