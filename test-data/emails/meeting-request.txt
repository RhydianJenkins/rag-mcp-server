Team,

Our external security audit has been completed and we need to review the findings together. I'm scheduling a mandatory meeting for all senior engineers.

Meeting Details:
- Date: January 23, 2026
- Time: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Location: Conference Room B / Zoom link will be sent
- Agenda: Review of critical and high-priority vulnerabilities

Critical items that need immediate attention:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in the reporting module
- Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
- Missing authentication on several API endpoints

Please block this time on your calendars. We'll need to create an action plan with ownership and timelines during this meeting.

Security is our top priority, and we need to address these issues before our next release.

Lisa Thompson
Director of Engineering
