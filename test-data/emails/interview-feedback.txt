Interview feedback for Sarah Thompson - Senior Frontend Engineer position

Overall: Strong hire

Technical Skills (9/10):
Crushed the coding challenge. Implemented a complex React component with hooks, proper error handling, and even added loading states without being asked. Code was clean and well-organized. Knew her stuff on performance optimization - talked about React.memo, useMemo, code splitting, all the good stuff.

System Design (7/10):
Solid understanding of frontend architecture. Proposed a reasonable approach for the real-time dashboard problem. Could have gone deeper on caching strategies but overall good.

Communication (10/10):
Explained her thinking clearly. Asked great questions. Didn't just jump into coding, actually thought about requirements first. This is rarer than it should be.

Culture Fit (8/10):
Seems like she'd fit in well. Collaborative, humble, good sense of humor. Mentioned she's big on code reviews and documentation which we desperately need.

Red Flags:
None really. She's switching from a competitor but for good reasons (they're not doing remote work, we are).

Concerns:
- Salary expectations are at the top of our range ($140K)
- She needs to give 4 weeks notice
- Only 3 years experience (we wanted 5+ but she's clearly sharp)

Recommendation: Hire
She's the best candidate we've interviewed for this role. Let's move fast before someone else scoops her up.
